A Hindu goes to his Muslim neighbor and asks if he could borrow a copy of the Quran.
“Of course,” said the Muslim. 
“We’ve got plenty! Let me go get you one from my library.” 
A week later, the Hindu returns. 
“Thanks so much,” he said. 
“Fascinating. But I wonder, could you give me a copy of the other Quran?”
“Um, you’re holding it there,” said the Muslim. 
“There’s just one Quran, and you’ve got it.”
“Yeah, I read it,” replied the Hindu.
“But I need a copy of the Quran that’s followed by Muslims.”
